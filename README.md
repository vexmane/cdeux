# cdeux
CDEUX is an application to which I write project ideas. It's kinda like a to-do list so the name comes from "c" as the C language and "deux" from the French word for "do" as in to-do.
TL:DR an application to write my project ideas to.

<h2> How to build: </h2>
You will need any C compiler.
To build with gcc simply run 'gcc .\cdeux.c -o cdeux'
